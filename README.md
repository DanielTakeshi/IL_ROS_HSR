# IL_ROS_HSR

This is a snapshot of the code used for:

- Robot Bed-Making: Deep Transfer Learning Using Depth Sensing of Deformable Fabric
- Daniel Seita, Nawid Jamali, Michael Laskey, Ron Berenstein, Ajay Kumar Tanwani, Prakash Baskaran,
Soshi Iba, John Canny, Ken Goldberg
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09810

This repository will not be updated further, to ensure that code can be re-run as needed to
reproduce results. To see any follow-up work, [check out the BerkeleyAutomation version][2] of this
repository (use a separate virtualenv).

If you want to see the old README I had before I removed images to save memory, [look at this from
my homepage][1]. It contains some outdated stuff so please take this with a grain of salt.
