# Scripts

- `check_raw_data.py`: for checking the data after we collect rollouts.
- `check_raw_data_plot.py`: after running the prior script, use this to plot in case it's easier to
  code this together.
- `data_augmentation_example.py`: for inspecting data augmentation. Works for both RGB and depth
  images.
